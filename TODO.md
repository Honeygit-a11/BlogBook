# TODO: Implement Blog Content Truncation on Dashboard

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Modify Dashboard.jsx to truncate blog content to the first 2 lines in the blog cards
- [x] Verify that the "Read More" link navigates to the full blog detail page (BlogDetail.jsx already handles full content display)
- [x] Test the changes to ensure truncation works and full blog opens on click
- [ ] Verify that the "Read More" link navigates to the full blog detail page (BlogDetail.jsx already handles full content display)
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure truncation works and full blog opens on click

## Notes:
- Truncate by splitting content on '\n' and taking the first 2 elements.
- The "Read More" link is already present and functional.
